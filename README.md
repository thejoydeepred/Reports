# Why Stale Market Reports Hurt Your Strategy (And How Next Move Strategy Consulting Keeps Data Updated)

One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen companies make is relying on outdated market data.

Graphene technology moves quickly. New production methods, partnerships, and research breakthroughs happen all the time. A report that’s six months old can already miss key shifts. That’s risky when you’re making investment or expansion decisions.

I’ve personally seen strategies fall apart because they were built on numbers that no longer reflected reality.

What stands out about Next Move Strategy Consulting is that they update their reports right before delivery. That means you’re not buying old data sitting on a shelf. You’re getting the most current snapshot available at the time.

They also provide forecasts all the way to 2030, which helps with long-term planning instead of short-term guessing.

In a fast-moving market like graphene, fresh data isn’t a bonus — it’s essential.
